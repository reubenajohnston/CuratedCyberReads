# Curated Cyber Reads
An open project with categorized, curated lists of cyber reads.  For updates, please either create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request) or contact me via email with details.

The list below contains links to the generated pdf files (they are also available in the Releases section).  Their corresponding latex files are named similarly and are located in the repository code.  
* [Curated List of Infamous Malware](https://github.com/reubenajohnston/CuratedCyberReads/releases/download/v1.1/curated_list_of_infamous_malware_reuben_johnston.pdf)
* [Curated List of Infamous Attacks](https://github.com/reubenajohnston/CuratedCyberReads/releases/download/v1.1/curated_list_of_infamous_attacks_reuben_johnston.pdf)

See the Documentation file for details on how 
the pdf documents are built via Github Actions.
