# Curated Cyber Reads
An open project with categorized, curated lists of cyber reads that will be used in a teaching context.  For updates, please either create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request) or contact me via email with details.  All contributions will receive acknowledgement in corresponding documents, so please also provide desired contact details with your pull requests (e.g., name and email address).

The list below contains links to the generated documents, in pdf format.  Their corresponding latex files are named similarly and are located in the repository code.

the pdf documents are built via Github Actions.
