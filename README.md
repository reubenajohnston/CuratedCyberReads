# Curated Cyber Reads
A project with categorized, curated lists of cyber reads.  For updates, please either create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request) or contact me via email with details.

The documents are built from latex into pdf format via Github Actions.  The list below contains links to the pdf files (they are also available in the Releases section).
